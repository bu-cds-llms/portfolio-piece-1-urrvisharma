# Project 

Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews Using Classical NLP and Neural Networks

# Overview

This project compares natural language processing techniques (Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF) with a neural network approach for sentiment classification on Amazon reviews. My goal is to find whether deep learning provides meaningful improvements over classical models.

# Methods

Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words

Logistic Regression with TF-IDF

Neural Network 

# Key Results

Classical models achieved ~93% accuracy. It had a similar outcome to the neural network while requiring less complexity.

# How to Run

Open 593Portfolio1.ipynb and run all cells

# Requirements

Python, pandas, numpy, sklearn, pytorch, matplotlib, seaborn, gensim
