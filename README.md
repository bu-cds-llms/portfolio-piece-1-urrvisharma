# Portfolio Piece Assignment

This repository is a template for your portfolio piece. You'll build on your weekly labs to create a polished, well-documented project that demonstrates your understanding of the concepts we've covered.

## What You're Building

Your portfolio piece could be a Jupyter notebook (or set of notebooks), or another reporting format (PDF with embedded images, etc.) that:
- Demonstrates understanding of course concepts
- Includes working, well-documented code (in notebooks or imported scripts)
- Analyzes results critically
- Tells a clear story from problem/question to approach to results and insights

If you'd like, this can become part of your professional portfolio, so treat it as work you'd be proud to show a potential employer or collaborator.

## Grading

Your work will be evaluated on:
- **Conceptual Understanding** (5 pts): Do you explain *why* you chose specific methods? Do you connect to course material?
- **Technical Implementation** (5 pts): Does your code run without errors? Do all components work correctly?
- **Code Quality & Documentation** (5 pts): Is your notebook/code clear and well-organized? Does it tell a story?
- **Critical Analysis** (5 pts): Do you interpret results thoughtfully? Discuss limitations and tradeoffs?
- **Peer Reviews** (5 pts): Did you provide constructive feedback on two classmates' projects?

See the full [rubric](https://lauren897.github.io/cds593-private/rubrics.html#portfolio-piece-rubric) for details.

## Suggested Repository Structure

You're free to organize this however makes sense for your project, but here's a structure that works well:

```
your-portfolio-piece/
├── README.md (this file - update it with your project details)
├── requirements.txt or equivalent
├── notebooks/
│   └── main_analysis.ipynb (or multiple notebooks)
├── src/ (optional - if you refactor code into modules)
├── data/ (see note below about data)
├── outputs/ (figures, saved models, etc.)
```

**About data**: If your dataset is small (<10 MB), you can include it in the repo. For larger datasets, put instructions in your README for how to download/access it, and add data files to `.gitignore`.

## Writing a Good README

Once you've completed your project, update this README to include:

1. **Project Title** - make it descriptive
2. **Overview** - 2-3 sentences: what problem are you solving and why?
3. **Methods** - what approaches did you use? Why these choices?
4. **Key Results** - what did you find? (keep it brief, details go in the notebook)
5. **How to Run** - step-by-step instructions so someone can reproduce your work
6. **Requirements** - what packages/versions are needed?

Your README should make it easy for someone to understand what you did and run your code.

## Peer Review Process

You'll be assigned two classmates' repositories to review. Provide your feedback through **pull requests**:

1. Clone your assigned classmate's repository to your machine
2. Read through their notebooks, scripts, and documentation
3. Try running the code yourself
4. Create a pull request with inline comments on their code/analysis
5. In the PR description, provide overall feedback addressing:
   - What worked well conceptually and technically?
   - What could be clearer in the documentation or analysis?
   - Specific suggestions for deeper analysis or improvements
   - Overall strengths of the project

Be constructive and specific. Good peer reviews identify both strengths and areas for growth.

You are *not* grading each other's pieces, just providing feedback.

## Timeline

- **Friday, Feb 20**: Portfolio piece due (push your final version to this repo)
- **Friday, Feb 27**: Peer reviews due (submit PRs with feedback to your assigned classmates' repos)

## Questions?

We can discuss more in class, in office hours, in discussion, and you can ask on Piazza.
